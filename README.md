This Data is for the Arsenal soccer Team Performance in the premiere League in the last seasons.
Data is downloaded from https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/data-sets-2020/
This project was made for the week 4 assignement of the Coding Dojo Data Science.
Data is sorted by Seasons's goals scored, goals accepted, games won,lost and drawn and Finally the no of Premiere League wins.
After Cleaning the data which had 2 Null values I have done some analysis in order to =show a decision maker the following :
a) Bar Chart to show the sum of won games vs lost and drawn in the last five years
b) Histograme for the points gained in eeach season.
c) Histograme for the Goal diffrence "Goals accepted and Goals scored" which can show the performance of the defense and Ofence players through out the season.
d) Scatter Plot for the Goals scored and the finals points " 1 is winning the league"
 which showed a positive correlation.
